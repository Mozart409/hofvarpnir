//! The `DownloadSupervisor` is a singleton that manages download concurrency.
//! It holds a `tokio::sync::Semaphore` with a configurable number of permits
//! (default 3) and spawns short-lived `DownloadWorker` actors when permits
//! are available. It also handles retry logic with exponential backoff.
